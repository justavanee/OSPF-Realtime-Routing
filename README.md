# Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Simulation

### This project showcases the following :
- Implements OSPF and calculates shortest path using Djikstra's algorithm
  
- Link State Advertisement (LSA)
- Real time events like congestion, link failures which changes routing decisions
- Addition of new links or nodes
- Evaluate network performance with Quality of Service (QoS) constraints to ensure efficient data flow
- Interactive graphs for visualisation

### Prerequisites :
- `Python 3.13.0` with `matplotlib` and `networkx` packages installed
  
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib networkx
    ```
### Getting started :
- Run the command to experience the simulation

  ```bash
    python ospf.py
    ```
- All information about the project is provided in the project report.
